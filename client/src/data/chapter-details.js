At our core, we are looking for students who have a passion for music as well as a heart to serve their local community. Our general meetings, socials, and fundraisers are welcome to both musicians and non-musicians alike. However, most of our performance-based outreach opportunities, such as our senior home concerts and mentorship program, require some experience in singing or playing an instrument. Students who perform in our senior home concerts, for example, are welcome to perform a song or piece of any genre or difficulty, so long as their performances are well prepared and suitable for their musical abilities.",
    "Students interested in participating in our mentorship program with the Goleta Union School District are expected to have a high level of instrumental proficiency and musicianship. To participate in the mentorship program, students must undergo an application process as well as a brief interview and performance screening with at least two officers on the mentorship board. In our screening process, we look at our candidates’ playing abilities, musical education background as well as prior experience working with children.",
