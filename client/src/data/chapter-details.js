Unfortunately, music has a lot of barriers, especially financial. We want to reach over these barriers to give more opportunities for Chicago children to also experience the connection to music that we have. We have various roles for interested students, including mentors, performers, and members of the fundraising comittee. Some of our activities include sharing music with the elderly through performances at Evanston retirement homes within the Northwestern locale. We will soon to be piloting virtual music mentorship program with an Evanston elementary school. While being a mentor or a performer does require some music knowledge — and any music knowledge is quite enough, we are not planning auditions of any sort — anyone that expresses interest is welcome within our fundraising committee."

At our core, we are looking for students who have a passion for music as well as a heart to serve their local community. Our general meetings, socials, and fundraisers are welcome to both musicians and non-musicians alike. However, most of our performance-based outreach opportunities, such as our senior home concerts and mentorship program, require some experience in singing or playing an instrument. Students who perform in our senior home concerts, for example, are welcome to perform a song or piece of any genre or difficulty, so long as their performances are well prepared and suitable for their musical abilities.",
        "Students interested in participating in our mentorship program with the Goleta Union School District are expected to have a high level of instrumental proficiency and musicianship. To participate in the mentorship program, students must undergo an application process as well as a brief interview and performance screening with at least two officers on the mentorship board. In our screening process, we look at our candidates’ playing abilities, musical education background as well as prior experience working with children."
